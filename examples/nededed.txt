-DH parameters of a 4-chain in symbolic notation
- delete (non parametrized hyperplanes) -> 2 parameters set of hyperplanes
-combine 2 chain with left chain
- remove line 5 
	fix a value to any one of the joint parameters change u_1i u_2i to u_1 u_2 w
-make aline in algo such that it checks if g1 and g2 is equal to zero


- define
